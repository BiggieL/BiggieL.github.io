    <h1>My Project Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Over the past few years, I have worked on and created games, apps, scripts, and more. I have experience in database management, reverse engineering, game design, android development, UI and graphics design, and music production! Come check out
    some of my work, much of it is rough around the edges but I am very proud of what my group members and I have accomplished. </p>

  <a href="https://github.com/cstrick13/Escape-VR" class="project-card">
    <h3>Steampunk VR Escape Room</h3>
      <p class="desc">
      You wake up on a flying ship, drifting through a maelstrom as it slowly
      falls from the sky. Solve immersive steampunk puzzles in VR to restore
      the ship—or die trying.

      <h3>Game Jam 2025 – 3D Platformer</h3>
      <p class="desc">
        Built in just 48 hours for the 2025 Game Jam. Rough but charming, with
        experimental movement and a UI style I’m still proud of.

      <h3>3D Precision Platformer</h3>
      <p class="desc">
        A narrative-driven precision platformer centered around movement,
        grappling, and dimensional shifting. I developed the core movement,
        camera, physics, gamefeel, sound effects, and one of the most challenging
        levels in the game.

            <a href="https://github.com/wjb035/403-project">QuickDraw</a>
            <p class="desc">QuickDraw is a drawing game that our group created for a project, while using Kotlin for the first time to develop an android app. In QuickDraw, you are given a randomized prompt every single day and you have a small time frame to draw said prompt. 
              Upon submitting your drawing, you can view every other users' drawings for that prompt, and vote on which one is the best! This app includes social customization, with custom profiles and the ability to add friends. I also created a backend server that is ready to deploy at any time, which means
              this app can be ran by anyone from any device as long as the server is up. There are currently no plans to finish this app and upload it to the appstore,  but it was quite a great learning experience.</p>

            Program and Script Bundle
          </a>
          <p class="desc">
            A collection of the scripts we wrote over the course of a semester. This ranges anywhere from cyphers to timelock tools to chat clients. 
            The main scripts are all compiled in the pile_bunker folder. If you would like to read documentation on these tools for personal use, you can read the pile bunker README file.

            <a href="https://github.com/wjb035/405-project">Pretty Good Emulator</a>
            <p class="desc">We aim to make Pretty Good Emulator a high quality and fluid emulation frontend, with an emphasis on a slick user experience and social features. These features include customizable profiles,
              statuses, the ability to add friends and play with them, and achievmenet tracking. Emulation frontends tend to be designed by programmers, for programmers, and lack a polished user experience. We aim to 
              solve that issue with this project.</p>

            <p class="desc">Along with an entire community of coders, we aim to completely reverse engineer Metal Gear Solid Integral for PlayStation back to C source code, which is a monumental task. The game is split up into many different overlays
            which need to be decompiled seperately, which is proving to be quite the undertaking.</p>
